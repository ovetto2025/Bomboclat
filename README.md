Developmet app for the Artiglieria Museum of Turin  

# Artillery Museum App - Technical Documentation
## 1. Introduction
The Artillery Museum App is an Android application designed to enhance the visitor experience at the Artillery Museum. It provides interactive features, digital content, and QR code-based interactions to guide users through the museum and its exhibits.

## 2. Architecture Overview
- **Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for separation of concerns and testability
- **Navigation:** Android Navigation Component with single-activity, multi-fragment structure
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt for scalable and maintainable DI
- **Data Layer:** Repository pattern with Room for local storage and Retrofit for remote data

## 3. Main Features & Logic
### 3.1 Home & Navigation
- Home screen with museum overview and featured exhibits
- Navigation drawer/menu for quick access to main sections
- SafeArgs for type-safe navigation between fragments

### 3.2 Exhibit Details
- Dynamic exhibit detail screens with images, descriptions, and audio guides
- Offline caching of exhibit data for reliability

### 3.3 QR Code Interaction
- Camera integration via CameraX and ML Kit Barcode Scanning
- QR codes placed near exhibits allow users to scan and access related content
- Real-time QR code detection and feedback
- Error handling for invalid or unrecognized codes

### 3.4 Camera Activity & Fragment
- **CameraActivity:** Hosts the camera fragment and manages permissions
- **CameraFragment:** Handles CameraX preview, QR code scanning, and result callbacks
- Permission checks and user prompts for camera access
- Lifecycle-aware camera resource management

### 3.5 User Experience
- Material Design UI with custom theming
- Responsive layouts for phones and tablets
- Dark mode and accessibility support
- Smooth transitions and animations

## 4. Data Management
- **Local:** Room database for exhibits and user preferences
- **Remote:** Retrofit for API calls to fetch latest museum data (to be implemented)
- **Caching:** Image and data caching for performance

## 5. Security & Privacy
- Secure storage of user data
- Encrypted network communication (HTTPS)
- Runtime permission management for camera and storage

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for ViewModels and repositories
- Instrumented UI tests with Espresso
- Continuous Integration pipeline for automated builds and tests
## 7. Error Handling
- Centralized error handler for network, camera, and QR scanning issues
- User-friendly error messages and retry options
- Crash reporting integration

## 8. Deployment & Maintenance
- Gradle build system with variant management
- Play Store release pipeline
- Modular codebase for easy feature updates

## 9. Future Improvements
- Augmented Reality (AR) for interactive exhibits
- Multi-language support
- Virtual tours and remote access features
- Enhanced accessibility options
